#DSRC Research
My graduate research that involves providing location verification to nodes in VANETs.
This is done by comparing packet Angle of Arrival (AOA) information with peer recommendations.
Four devices were used to test the verification method that used TI Tivas and Mikro GPS and WiFi modules.
